There is an abandoned village on Orkney Islands at the north of England.
It was abandoned long ago, when the pyramids were just started to be built.
Its name is Skara Brae. I made it for my history project. The license is Creative Commons Attribution 4.0.
Feel free to explore the village. 

Bonus: There is two more monuments to discover!
